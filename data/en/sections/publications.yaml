  paper:
    summary: In this thesis, I analize the effect of NATFTA on the agricultural sector of Mexico. In specific, I focus in the affect on foreig trade (exports and inports) and productivitie for the sector in general and for some specifict products. 
          To estimate the effect, I apply the Synthetic Control Method (Abadie, 2003).
